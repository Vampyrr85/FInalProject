                            We're cranking up the volume at the Rowe Bro's with live concerts in our new event space! We will have local bands coming in to play while you hang out, browse games, or join in any of our tournaments. It's a fun, low-key way to enjoy music and connect with our communityâ€”right alongside the hobbies you already love. Whether you're stopping by for a quick match or staying all evening, the music adds something extra. Simple, relaxed, and a good time all around.

                            We are looking for the wild and creative here at Rowe Bro's with cosplay contests held bi-monthly! Whether you're donning full armor, mixing it up in a clever mash-up, or just becoming one with your favorite character, we are here for it. Sign up and come show off your designs.  Enjoy the mix of games, laughs, and engagement. Have fun, meet fellow fans, and maybe even win a prize. There is no pressure, so come as you are (or who you want to be) just make sure to bring the energy!
